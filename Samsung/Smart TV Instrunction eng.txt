Before using it:
1. Open script code editor
2. Change MAC address of the control panel
3. Change TV model.

4. Don't change commands names - the script uses them.
5. Don't change "Script Mode" parameter - the script won't work. That is why I can't make database from this driver - I found it impossibile to change this parameter for the driver added to database.
6. Set the correct IP address of the TV manually - it is better not to setup IP address automatically (DHCP).
7. Switch ON the TV.


Example in the script:

/** TV device parameters:

 1. Input a name of the driver from the project device panel, for example "Samsung (Net)"
 2. TYPE MAC-ADDRESS OF THE CONTROL PANEL (iPAD, Laptop, etc.) HERE IN FORMAT 00-00-00-00-00-00
 3. CHANGE TV MODEL UE32F6330 on yours 
 
 */
var myTV =  new Samsung_net_main("Samsung (Net)", "00-00-00-00-00-00", "UE32F6330");

/** To add more TVs for controling:

    1. Copy the driver "Samsung (Net)" in the project device panel, the new driver
       will has the name "Samsung (Net) 1"
    2. Copy the line 
       var myTV =  new Samsung_net_main("Samsung (Net)", "00-00-00-00-00-00", "UE32F6330");
    3. Change line with new TV parameters (Driver name, mac, model) 
    
 */

Two TV example in the script

var myTV_1 =  new Samsung_net_main("Samsung (Net) 1", "00-00-00-00-00-00", "UE32F6330");
var myTV_2 =  new Samsung_net_main("Samsung (Net) 2", "00-00-00-00-00-00", "UE32F6370");
